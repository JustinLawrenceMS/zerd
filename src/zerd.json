Under the bough of the tree you see a crudely but well camouflaged door and you hear a din of laughter rattling off from far away in the dungeon. Just then, you see the wings of a large bird or flying reptile silhouetted against the moon. You see the glow of something like a window or a stationary oil lamp off in a distant part of the forest. What do you want to do now?"

He tells you that he is the Wizard Siamor, and that it is his eternal duty to guard the forest from the Goblin King. \"He is gaining in strength,\" says Siamor, \"and he must be stopped. Will you swear allegiance to the Gnomish King and stop the Goblin invasion?\" <button id=\"siamor-yes\" class=\"zerd-btn\">Yes.</button><button class=\"zerd-btn\" id=\"siamor-no\">No.</button>"

You must retrieve it from the depths of the dungeon.' He hands you a glowing orb. 'This will light your way and protect you from goblin magic.' What do you do now?"

'But know this: if you will not help us, darkness will consume this realm... and eventually, the world beyond.' He turns away. 'You are free to go, but the dungeon door will remain a mystery to you.' You feel the weight of the world's fate resting on your shoulders. What do you want to do now?"

You reach a small chamber with three tunnels before you. The left tunnel glows faintly red. The center tunnel smells of sulfur. The right tunnel echoes with running water. Which tunnel do you choose?"

A massive red drake sleeps on an island of black rock in the center. Its treasure hoard glimmers with gold and jewels. But you also see something else—a smaller tunnel leading deeper, and on a nearby rock, you spot the faint outline of the Crystal of Starlight! How do you proceed?"

Suddenly, you hear chittering and see hundreds of pairs of glowing eyes in the shadows. Goblin warriors! 'Intruder!' they screech. 'The King will reward us for your capture!' What do you do?"

In the center is a stone bridge spanning the river. On the far side, you see an ornate door carved with images of stars and moons. Your instinct tells you this is important. But first, you must cross the bridge. You notice the water below swirls ominously. What do you do?"

Your vision blurs. You stumble backward and fall. The goblins laugh. It seems your adventure has come to an end. THE END."

	{

		"setting_id":5,
		"setting_description":"fight or flee",
		"if_answer":"run",
		"then_question":"You spin around and sprint back down the tunnel. Goblin shouts echo behind you, but your heart pounds with adrenaline and you move faster. You burst back into the main chamber and—quick thinking!—you seal the tunnel entrance with a pile of rocks. Their angry voices fade. You've bought yourself time, but now you must find another route to the crystal. What will you do?"

		"then_question":"You move silently along the cavern wall, keeping low. The drake's breathing is deep and rhythmic—it's still asleep. You're almost to the crystal when a loose stone crunches under your foot. The drake's eye opens! It raises its massive head and sniffs the air. A low rumble emanates from its chest. Do you run, hide, or try to communicate?"

		"setting_description":"bridge - crossing",
		"if_answer":"cross the bridge",
		"then_question":"You take a deep breath and step onto the stone bridge. It holds steady. Halfway across, you hear a splash below. Something large moves in the water. Ripples disturb the surface. Then you see it—a massive serpent, easily as long as the river is wide, with scales that shimmer like moonlight. It surfaces and looks at you with ancient, intelligent eyes. But it doesn't attack. Instead, it bows slightly. What do you do?"
	},
	{

		"then_question":"The ornate door swings open silently. Beyond is a chamber even more breathtaking than the cavern outside. The walls glow with soft, ethereal light. In the center of the chamber, suspended in mid-air, hovers the Crystal of Starlight. It's more beautiful than you could have imagined—radiating pure, white light with hints of blue and purple. Around it, you sense ancient magic. This is what everyone has been seeking. But how will you claim it?"

Suddenly, visions flood your mind: the history of the realm, the rise of the Goblin King, the sacrifice the gnomes made to protect the crystal. You understand now—the crystal chose you. As the shaking stops, you hear a voice: 'You are worthy.' What do you do with the crystal?"

His face brightens when he sees the glowing crystal. 'You did it,' he whispers in awe. 'You have restored hope to our realm.' As he takes the crystal, a wave of golden light spreads across the land. The darkness begins to recede. The goblin forces retreat in fear. Peace is returning. VICTORY!"

		"then_question":"You pocket the crystal and make your way back through the dungeon. But as you walk, you feel the crystal growing warm—almost hot. Whispers fill your mind, growing louder. The weight of the realm's fate presses down on you. You realize: keeping it for yourself means eternal torment and the slow decay of the world. In a moment of clarity, you understand what must be done. You must return it. But will it be too late?"
